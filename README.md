# Access Layer Server

This repository contains the backend API for Access Layer.

The server is the off-chain layer for the product. It handles the parts of the marketplace that do not need to live inside Stellar smart contracts, while coordinating with the client and contracts as the product grows.

## Purpose

The server is responsible for:

- creator and user profile management
- auth and session-related flows
- creator metadata and perk definitions
- indexing contract activity for faster reads
- notifications, analytics, and moderation workflows
- access checks for gated off-chain content
- trade webhooks for external integrations
- a centralised Soroban contract interaction service that wraps all on-chain submissions with retry, error classification, transaction tracking, and resolution events ([Soroban Contract Service Reference](./docs/soroban-contract-service.md))

See [Backend Domain Model and Endpoint Boundaries](./docs/architecture/domain-boundaries.md) for a technical overview, [Creator Data Model Reference](./docs/architecture/creator-data-model.md) for creator field definitions, [API Versioning](./docs/api-versioning.md) for details on schema versioning, [API Timeout Configuration](./docs/api-timeouts.md) for timeout defaults, [Rate Limiting Configuration](./docs/rate-limiting.md) for rate limit defaults and guidelines, and [Trade Webhooks Reference](./docs/webhooks.md) for webhook payload and delivery behavior.

## Tech

- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL

## Current state

- Express app bootstrap exists in [src/app.ts](./src/app.ts)
- common backend middleware is already scaffolded
- reusable starter utilities are kept in generic Access Layer-safe form

## Local setup

New contributors should follow the [Local Development Setup Guide](./docs/local-development-setup.md) — it covers prerequisites, environment configuration, migrations, seeding, starting the API server and indexer, and verifying the result end to end.

Condensed version for returning contributors:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill the required credentials — see the setup guide
pnpm db:up
pnpm generate
pnpm migrate
pnpm dev
```

**Configuration:** See [Configuration Guide](./docs/configuration.md) for detailed information about environment variables, source precedence, and validation rules.

## Database

This repo includes a local PostgreSQL container for development.

Start the database:

```bash
pnpm db:up
```

Watch database logs:

```bash
pnpm db:logs
```

Stop the database:

```bash
pnpm db:down
```

The default connection string in `.env.example` matches the included Docker setup.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Health Check

The server provides health check endpoints for local development and production monitoring:

### Simple Health Check

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health`

Returns a minimal response suitable for load balancers and uptime monitors:

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "message": "OK",
   "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Detailed Health Check

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health/detailed`

Returns comprehensive service status including database connectivity:

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "message": "Access Layer server is running",
   "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "environment": "development",
   "uptime": 12345.67,
   "memory": {
      "used": 45.23,
      "total": 128.5
   },
   "system": {
      "platform": "win32",
      "nodeVersion": "v20.10.0"
   },
   "database": {
      "status": "connected",
      "responseTime": 12
   },
   "services": [
      {
         "name": "API Server",
         "status": "healthy"
      },
      {
         "name": "Database",
         "status": "healthy"
      }
   ]
}
```

**Response Codes:**

- `200 OK` - All services healthy (or development mode)
- `503 Service Unavailable` - Database disconnected in production

### Usage Examples

**Local Development:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health/detailed
```

**Production Monitoring:**

```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/v1/health
```

### Indexer Heartbeat

The server also tracks the health of the background indexing worker.

**Status Check Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/health/indexer`

Returns the current status of the indexer worker:

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "data": {
      "service": "indexer",
      "status": "healthy",
      "lastSuccessfulRun": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
      "staleSinceMs": null
   }
}
```

**Response Codes:**

- `200 OK` - Indexer is healthy (or unknown if never run)
- `503 Service Unavailable` - Indexer is degraded (heartbeat is stale)

**Record Heartbeat Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/health/indexer/heartbeat`

Called by the indexer worker to record a successful run:

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "data": {
      "recorded": true,
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
   },
   "message": "Heartbeat recorded"
}
```

**Docker/Kubernetes Health Probes:**

````yaml
livenessProbe:
   httpGet:
      path: /api/v1/health
      port: 3000
   initialDelaySeconds: 10
   periodSeconds: 30

readinessProbe:
   httpGet:
      path: /api/v1/health/ready
      port: 3000
   initialDelaySeconds: 5
   periodSeconds: 10

## Ledger Sync Status

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/ledger/status`

Returns the latest indexed ledger number, its opaque cursor, and the timestamp of the last successful sync. Used by clients to verify that the off-chain data is current.

```json
{
   "success": true,
   "data": {
      "ledger": 1234567,
      "cursor": "1234567-000",
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
   }
}
````

```
